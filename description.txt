UFRJ Sectoral Model (ver. 1.0)
*******************************
_________________________________________________________________________________________________

This model is a complete rewrite of the sectoral model developed by the Economic Dynamics Reasearch Group of Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.
There are some adaptations and innovations in this versions but they can be turned off to have the exactly the same model as in the reference paper.

THE MODEL:
**********

The model is based on Keynesian, Kaleckian and Schumpeterian theoretical foundations.
The model represents a theoretical productive sector, composed by N number of firms. 
Firms compete is this market (sector) via Prices and via Product Differentiation (Quality, in a broad sense).
In line with the Keynesian Effective Demand Principle, firms produce based on expected sales, under adaptative expectation rules, and there is no required equilibrium between production and effective sales.
Firms set price in line with Kaleckian theory of price setting under oligopolistic competition, meaning that firms take into consideration their competitive position in the market and look at the others to set their price.
Firms also perform R&D, in line with a Neo-schumpeterian approach. The amount of resources to R&D is a fixed share of revenue and is allocated between process R&D and product R&D. In its turn, the resourcers allocated to each type is again divided between innovation and imitation.
Process R&D searches for new levels of productivity while Product R&D searches for new levels of product quality. Innovation depends on exogenous technological opportunities while imitation depends on the current maximum level in the sector.
Finally, firms make investment decisions, divided in expansion investment (to adjust productive capacity to a desired level based on expected sales) and replacement investment (to modernize current technologically obsolete capital goods).
Investment decisions can be financially constrained, and irms prioritize internal sources of funds in relation to external sources (credit). If total funds are not enough, firms prioritize expantion investment.
Firm's price and quality affect its competitiveness index, which defines the firm's market share. The market share serves to distribute sectoral demand in a quasi-replicator dynamics.
Total sectoral demand in semi-endogenous: it depends on a exogenous growth rate with a random shock plus the growth rate of sectoral average quality. 
Success in product R&D (quality increase) also allow firms to increase their desired markup, affecting functional income distribution in a sectoral level.
